# Don't be afraid, it will be fun

Hey guys! I'm Marvin Frachet, a french frontend developer.

I am working on multiple frontend technologies from [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) to [Angular](https://angular.io/) & [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/).

I've written this little book because I'm really (and you seem too) interested in understanding what's happening under the
hood of my everyday tools.

I wanted to show you what are the different parts involved in a frontend framework (or library, I don't really care here)
and how we can build something that _works_ (it's not competitive on the market) using simple approaches and explanations.

If you have any question or suggestion concerning this book, please [open an issue to help the community!](https://github.com/mfrachet/create-frontend-framework/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

This website has been built using the awesomness of [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). I suggest you give it a try!

Oh, and before starting, I let you create a folder wherever you want in your machine using something like:

```
$ mkdir my-awesome-framework
$ cd my-awesome-framework
$ touch index.js
```
