# Other possible features to implement

This book introduces one of the multiple ways to create a frontend framework that reacts to interactions.

Here's an exhaustive list of what could / should be implemented:

- children rendering
- managing lifecycle: the biggest problem with our implementation is `How / When to fetch data?`
- improving performances
- managing style encapsulation (shadow DOM and alternatives)
- dependency injection system

A part of this has been implemented in [https://github.com/mfrachet/frontend-example/tree/master/framework](https://github.com/mfrachet/frontend-example/tree/master/framework)
